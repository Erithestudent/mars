     <P>Mars is an 18-year-old demon who prefers to keep to himself. He is quiet and rides solo, navigating the challenges of high school despite hating the crowded environment.

Ever since a traumatic incident, Mars has been easily triggered, especially by the sight of blood. This trauma makes him anxious and fearful, driving his determination to become stronger to protect his family.
