   <P> Mars is a demon living in a world where demons are common and not greatly feared. However, there are those who want his race eradicated and are willing to kill them at any opportunity.

Aware of the constant threat, Mars knows he must get stronger to protect his family. In demon culture, the size of one's horns signifies their strength. However, growing horns is a difficult and slow process. Mars tries to force their growth, but when he pushes too hard, they shrink instead.

When Mars's horns do grow, his physical strength increases and his eyes begin to glow with power.
